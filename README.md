next time am working on this program i have to make it anounce the winner at the end of the game an the number of fouls commited by both teams.
Today i have done the html and css part so next tome i will be working on the javascript part to make the program responsive.
I should add a reset button that will return everything to their absolute normal state.
I should add a timer that will enable the players to track the game as it progresses and they should be able to also pause the time when they want to stop the game for a break or a time out.
As of 27th December i have done the html and css of the clockface on this program now all that is reamining is the javascript part of it so that it can be responsive.
I have to say am really proud of this small steps am making in this programmer jounery of mine it is very satisfactory.
